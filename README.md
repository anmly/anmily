# Here's to loving you every day for the rest of my life

## 21 Apr
I got my permanency at work oh and I also saw a car with 1011 plates ðŸ˜Œ

### Accidental?
Forgive me, I have always harbored feelings for you all these years. Perhaps that dream that made me reach out to you was just a catalyst to the beginning of something. I don't know the what or why but it did happen. Having you reciprocate my feelings was probably the peak of my life (as of today).

### Wonder
Do you still want to know how my day went, as much as I want to know yours? Because I am always ready to be all ears for you. Day and night I am willing to listen to you. How was work? What did you have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? Did anything funny happen over the day? Will you be hanging out afterwards? So many more questions.

### Sparks
What has happened to our spark? I am still a small flame in the cold wind and not the raging inferno from before. I am sure I can burn that brightly again but you are an unknown. Is what's left of you merely ashes, or are there still embers waiting to set alight any bit of fuel that reaches you?

>And just like before your heart was already ~~someone's~~ mine

Correction to your poem. It is yours, my heart's all yours. Always will be, I believe.

### Dreams
Tell me your dreams, what drinks did we end up getting? This might be rude but it is not up to you alone to determine your place in another person's life. I know this because according to myself I belong right by your side but alas that is not the case.

I dream of you almost every day. I get to see you even though you are so distant in them. I think of you every day. I wish I could see you up close but that we will see.

Today's dream was different. We met and talked. It was amicable but I don't know what we talked about.
